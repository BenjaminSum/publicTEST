    Implementation of Antivirus Scanning and Malware Analysis:
        Ownership: This action has been entrusted to the 'Cyber Secure Enduser Experiences Control' team, possessing the appropriate expertise in this domain.
        Rationale: With confirmed awareness by network/control owners of every source and destination of traffic flows, there isn't an explicit need to activate antivirus/malware scanning for server-sourced flows via CNS Squid Proxies.

    Traffic Migration & Squid Proxy Decommissioning:
        Current Status: Considering the in-depth understanding by networks/control owners about all traffic trajectories, the existing CNS Squid Proxy infrastructure is determined to meet both strategic and financial benchmarks.
        Decision: Migration to a new proxy solution is not mandated, and consequently, the decommissioning of the CNS Squid Proxy is not pursued.
        Continuous Monitoring: Policy reviews led by the control teams validate this approach. To remain compliant with evolving security needs, these policies will undergo evaluation every quarter.

Evidence for Closing the Action Item:

    Documented Expertise: The delegation of tasks to the specialised 'Cyber Secure Enduser Experiences Control' team ensures tasks are managed by professionals with expertise in the field.
    Flow Management: Comprehensive traffic management by networks/control owners guarantees robust oversight over all internet access.
    Policy Review Records: Quarterly reviews by the control team substantiate that current policies align with the best practices and the latest security standards.
